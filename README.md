# PortWatcher
Monitors port reachability with notifications via Telegram and Gotify

This script monitors the reachability of a specific port on a given IP address. If the port becomes unreachable, it sends notifications about the port's status via Telegram and Gotify, avoiding repeated alerts until the port is reachable again. Upon recovery, a notification is sent, and monitoring continues.
