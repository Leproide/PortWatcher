# PortWatcher
Monitors port reachability with notifications via Telegram and Gotify

This script monitors the reachability of a specific port on a given IP address. If the port becomes unreachable, it sends notifications about the port's status via Telegram and Gotify, avoiding repeated alerts until the port is reachable again. Upon recovery, a notification is sent, and monitoring continues.

# Port Monitoring Script

This script monitors the reachability of a specific port on a server and sends notifications via Telegram and Gotify when the port is unreachable or back online.

## Troubleshooting

```bash
1. **Error: Command Not Found**
   - Ensure `nc` (Netcat) and `curl` are installed:

2. **Telegram Not Sending Messages**
   - Double-check the `telegramToken` and `telegramChatId` values.
   - Test your bot by visiting this URL in your browser:
     ```
     https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN>/sendMessage?chat_id=<YOUR_CHAT_ID>&text=TestMessage
     ```

3. **Gotify Not Sending Messages**
   - Ensure your Gotify server is running and accessible.
   - Verify your app token and server URL.

4. **Script Not Running**
